    <h1>Memaw's Cast Iron Skillet Cookie Recipe</h1>

    <p>This is where a lengthy, <b>pointless</b> story about the author's life would go, sharing all the stuff you don't care about, so you spend more time on their website.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I was just a young buck, I would spend a month out of my summer up on Memaw and Pappy's farm up in rural Oklahoma. Every morning I would wake up with the roosters, and after a big, hearty breakfast from my Memaw, I would get to work, helping out on the farm. After spending most of the day cleaning the stables, feeding the animals, and milking the cows, I would get a tuna sandwich, an ice-cold glass of milk, and one of Memaw's famous cast iron skillet cookies.</p>
    <p>Memaw's cookies always won the blue ribbon at the annual county fair, and it always filled me with pride to be able to enjoy one every day. My Memaw shared this recipe with me before she passed, and even though she's gone, I still make those chewy, delicious, chocolatey cookies in her memory. Now I'd like to pass my Memaw's recipe onto you and the reset of the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong><span style=color:red>DISCLAIMER:</span></strong> Absolutely <em>none</em> of the above story is true. I just like this recipe because it's easy and the cookie comes out soft and chewy.</p>
    <p>And like every other recipe blog, the actual recipe (or the link to said recipe, in this case) is at the bottom, after the long, boring story.</p>
